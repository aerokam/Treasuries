# CLAUDE.md - Treasuries Project

## Specs Drive Code (read before touching code)

This file is interaction/workflow guidance only — commands, tool gotchas, git hooks. It is **not** a substitute for the specs and must never restate spec content (see the top-level `CLAUDE.md`'s Specs-First Mandate and Single Source of Truth directive). Before touching code in a project that has a `knowledge/` folder, read the governing spec(s) first:

- **TipsLadderManager**: `TipsLadderManager/knowledge/1.0`–`6.0`, plus `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`, `PROJECT_VISION.md` in the same folder.
- **Shared/global** (R2 data stores, ingestion pipelines, domain terminology used by every app): repo-root `knowledge/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `Data_Pipeline.md`, `DataStores.md`, `Bond_Basics.md`, `TIPS_Basics.md`.
- **YieldCurves**: `YieldCurves/knowledge/` (SA/SAO adjustment logic, visual standards) plus the shared specs above for data pipeline facts — YieldCurves has no separate project-level data-pipeline spec of its own.

If a claim below ever conflicts with a spec, the spec wins — fix this file, don't propagate the stale claim.

## Help Text Follows the Specs

**User-facing text follows the specs exactly as code does**, and "specs" includes the repo-root
`knowledge/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, which is the foundation the rest of them rest on for terminology.
Help modals, popup rows, status strips, column headers and tooltips are all in scope.

- **Terms and phrases are defined once, in the DD, and used from there.** A word appearing in a
  spec is not proof it is a defined term: check the DD. Where a term is missing from the DD that
  should be there, add it rather than working around it.
- **Do not introduce a new term without asking first.** Not in help text, not in a spec, not in a
  reply. If no existing term covers what you mean, say so and ask.
- **Derive a definition from how a term is already used** where the usage settles it, rather than
  asking for something the formula or the code already determines.
- A spec section that restates a definition the DD owns is a duplicate: keep the link, drop the
  second copy.

**Read the Data Dictionary at the start of every session, not just the specs.** Read it whole, or at
minimum every entry touching the specs in play, before writing any prose. It is the vocabulary the
help text and the specs are written in, and it has to be in mind while writing rather than consulted
after the fact. Re-read it whenever that recall has faded — a session that has run long has lost it.

**The test is consistency with the specs, never whether it reads naturally.** Prose that reads well
is not evidence it is right; for this failure mode it is the opposite, because a term that was never
defined can read just as well as the one that was. Ask instead: is every term here the one the DD
defines?

**Do not replace a defined term with anything.** Not with a metaphor (*leg*, a *block* of years, a
CPI *print*, a value *stamped* at 17:05), and not with a plain synonym either. Where a term already
exists, it is the only correct word. Metaphors are fine in conversation with the user and are not
the problem in themselves; substituting one for a term already defined is. When nothing defined
fits, say what is missing and ask rather than coining anything. The user is the sole developer of
every portal app and the only person who can approve a new term.

**Match a summary of an external source to that source.** `YieldCurves/knowledge/Canty.md` is the
worked case: it holds itself out as the canonical summary of a paper, so a word the paper never uses
does not belong in it, however standard the word sounds.

**Vocabulary is one half; sentence construction is the other.** `knowledge/Writing_Style.md`
governs how a sentence is built once the terms in it are right: verbs state operations, processes
have no minds, numbers carry their basis, and a document does not discuss its own wording. Read it
alongside the Data Dictionary before writing prose.

**This rule is enforced, not just stated.** `.githooks/pre-commit` runs
`scripts/check-vocabulary.js`, which blocks a commit that introduces a banned term into prose a
reader meets: the `knowledge/` specs, `Primer/content/`, and the string literals in each app's
`index.html` and `src/`. Only lines the commit adds or changes are gated, so pre-existing wording
never blocks unrelated work. `node scripts/check-vocabulary.js --audit` lists what is already
there. When a commit is blocked, fix the wording; if no defined term fits, ask, and add the term to
the Data Dictionary. Adding a rule to that file is how a term ruled out in conversation stays ruled
out for every session afterwards.

## Multiple Sessions, One Branch

Several Claude sessions work this repo at once, all for the one developer, all in the primary
checkout `C:/Users/aerok/projects/Treasuries`, which stays on `main`. That checkout is what the
developer's `localhost:8080` server serves and tests, so every change has to land there.

This section changes as the developer's instructions change. A session that loaded it at its own
start may be holding a stale copy in context — if a judgment call here matters and there is any
doubt the copy is current, re-read the file from disk before deciding, rather than trust memory of
it.

**All work is done on `main`.** A session does not create a branch or a worktree on its own
judgment. There are exactly two reasons to work off `main`, both the developer's call — propose it
in plain terms and wait for a yes:

- an urgent bug fix that has to ship while unrelated unpushed work is sitting on `main`, or
- a large new enhancement the developer has agreed to build separately.

"Many files" or "a long sweep" is **not** a reason — that work goes on `main` too, committed in
small pieces as it goes.

### Sharing `main` with other sessions

- **Commit your own changes in small pieces, the moment each piece is done.** Stage the exact files
  and commit in the same step: `git add <path> <path> && git commit`. Never `git add -A`,
  `git add .`, or a bare directory. Never stage files and walk away — a concurrent commit will
  sweep them in, or block on them.
- **Uncommitted or staged changes you did not make are normal** — another session is mid-edit.
  Leave their files alone; do your own work in other files and commit it. You do not need their
  tree clean to commit yours. Stop and ask the developer only if their in-progress work genuinely
  blocks you — do not accuse, do not undo their changes.
- **Never move a branch by hand.** No `git update-ref`, `git branch -f`, a `git reset` that moves a
  branch, `git push --force`, or a cherry-pick to relocate a commit. A branch moves only by an
  ordinary commit, merge, or push.
- **Before a work pass**, run `git status` and `ListAgents`. If another session is editing the same
  files, message it (`SendMessage`) and agree who goes first.
- **Two full `npm run test:e2e` runs against the 8080 server at once interfere** and report
  failures that are not real. Check `ListAgents` before starting one. The pre-push hook already
  runs the suites for a push, so a routine push needs no separate run.
- **Pushing is the developer's explicit call, every time, and it means only the commits from the
  session being asked** — not everything else waiting on `main`. `main` usually carries unpushed
  work from several sessions at once, so "push" is scoped to the session unless the developer says
  otherwise.
  - If nothing else is unpushed, this is a plain push: `git push origin main`.
  - If other sessions' unpushed commits are mixed in, separate the session's own commits first and
    push just those — §Shipping less than all of `main` below. More steps, not harder; never push
    the mixed set to avoid them.
- **Do not delete a branch unless it is merged or the developer says so.** `retained-bracket-work`
  is kept unmerged on purpose (see `TipsLadderManager/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).

### Shipping less than all of `main`

Two cases need this: an urgent bug fix while unrelated unpushed work sits on `main` (the developer
approves working off `main` first, per the exception above), and pushing one session's own commits
past other sessions' unpushed ones (no approval needed beyond the push itself — this is just how a
scoped push is done). Same steps either way:

1. `git worktree add ../Treasuries-ship -b ship-<desc> origin/main` — a fresh checkout at the last
   pushed commit, so the rest of `main` is not in it.
2. Build the fix there and commit it, or `git cherry-pick <sha> <sha> …` the session's own commits
   onto it, oldest first. Verify (the developer gives a fix worked on its own a port; a cherry-pick
   of already-verified commits usually does not need re-testing).
3. From the primary checkout: `git push origin ship-<desc>:main` — ships only this. The developer
   approves the push itself, same as any push.
4. From the primary checkout on `main`: `git merge -s ours origin/main` — folds the shipped work
   back into local `main` without disturbing what is still unpushed (the working tree does not
   change).
5. `git worktree remove ../Treasuries-ship` and `git branch -d ship-<desc>`.

Never instead rewind `main` to the pushed commit and replay the rest afterward — that rewrites the
branch other sessions are committing on.

### Ports

- **8080** — the developer's own dev server on the primary checkout. Never start, kill, or restart
  it.
- **8081** — any branch or worktree, always this port, no exceptions and no session picking a
  different one. `npx serve . -p 8081` from the worktree root; the developer runs it.
- More ports need the developer to widen the R2 CORS allowlist (repo-root
  `knowledge/Data_Pipeline.md`). Ask.

## Commands (TipsLadderManager)

```bash
# Unit/algorithm tests
npm test

# E2E regression tests (run after every change)
npm run test:e2e          # headless, ~7s
npx playwright test --headed   # headed (debug)

# Serve locally (no build step required)
npx serve .
```

## Architecture (TipsLadderManager)

**No build step.** Pure ES modules served statically via GitHub Pages. Data fetched from Cloudflare R2 at runtime.

### Module Roles

Module responsibilities and the dependency graph (bond-math.js, gap-math.js, ladder-math.js, ladder-core.js, rebalance-lib.js, build-lib.js) are specified in `knowledge/4.0_Computation_Modules.md`; `render.js`/`drill.js` in `knowledge/5.0_UI_Schema.md`. Do not restate them here.

- `src/modal.js` — `makeDraggableResizable(modalEl, dragHandleEl, opts)`, shared drag/resize frame for every modal (TipsRef, maturity picker). *(Not documented in any spec yet — flagged for review, see task report.)*

### Key Algorithms

Phase 4 Ladder Rebuild: `knowledge/3.0_TIPS_Ladder_Rebalancing.md` §Phase 4. Retained Bracket Excess: `knowledge/2.0_TIPS_Ladders.md` §Retained Bracket Excess (also `DATA_DICTIONARY.md#retained-bracket-excess`, `DATA_DICTIONARY.md#active-lower-bracket`).

- `inferDARAFromCash()` (`src/rebalance-lib.js`): binary-searches for the largest DARA where `costDeltaSum >= 0`. *(Not documented in any spec — the specs describe a different mechanism, `inferScaledDARAFromPortfolio`'s self-financing scale. Flagged for review, see task report.)*

### COLS Schema

Column schema, rendering, and popup routing are specified in `knowledge/5.0_UI_Schema.md`. Do not restate here.

### Data Infrastructure

Yield-source pipeline (default vs. cross-check source) is specified in `knowledge/3.1_Data_Pipeline.md` §4.0. Full R2 file manifest: repo-root `knowledge/DataStores.md` / `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`.

- **Scheduled updates**: Windows Task Scheduler (local)

### Naming Conventions

*(Moved here from the YieldCurves section below, where it was misfiled — `fundedYear`/`runBuild` are TipsLadderManager-only concepts. Not documented in any spec — flagged for review, see task report.)*

- `fundedYear` (not `fy`) everywhere: `d.fundedYear`, `fundedYearQty`, `fundedYearAmt`, `fundedYearCost`; column header "Funded Year"
- `runBuild` (not `runBuildFromScratch`), `renderBuildOutput`, `buildSummary`, `buildDetails`, `build-table`

### Domain Terminology

Definitions (TIPS, funded year, bracket year, gap year, synthetic TIPS, LMI, retained bracket excess, active lower bracket, etc.) are in the repo-root `knowledge/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` §3.0/§4.0. Do not restate here.

## Architecture (YieldCurves)

**No build step.** Pure ES modules served statically via GitHub Pages.

### Commands

```bash
npm run test:e2e          # E2E regression tests (headless, ~14s)
npx playwright test --headed   # headed debug
npx serve .               # Serve locally (run from root of Treasuries repo)
```

### Data Infrastructure (R2)

R2 file manifest, update schedule, and ownership are specified in the repo-root `knowledge/Data_Pipeline.md` and `knowledge/DataStores.md` (covers `Treasuries/YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv`, `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuriesTips.csv`, `TIPS/RefCpiNsaSa.csv`, `TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv`, `misc/BondHolidaysSifma.csv`). Do not restate here.

### Fidelity Download Flow

Specified in the repo-root `knowledge/Data_Pipeline_Local.md` (gitignored — do not reference publicly per that file's own note).

### Windows / Tooling Note

The Edit tool may fail with `EEXIST` on project files (Windows path bug). Use node scripts via Bash to patch files when Edit fails.

**Never edit text files via PowerShell `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`/`Out-File`.** Windows PowerShell's `Get-Content` falls back to the system codepage (Windows-1252) when a file has no BOM, silently mis-decoding UTF-8 multi-byte characters (em dashes, smart quotes, arrows, non-breaking hyphens); writing the result back with `-Encoding UTF8` then bakes that corruption in as real Unicode text and adds a BOM. This exact bug corrupted `index.html` in commit `342e673`. If Edit fails and a script is truly needed, use Node (`fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')` / `fs.writeFileSync(path, text)`, both implicitly UTF-8, no BOM) instead. A pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/check-encoding.js`, wired via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) now blocks commits containing this mojibake pattern or a stray BOM as a backstop.
