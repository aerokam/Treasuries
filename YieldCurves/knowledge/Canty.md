# Seasonally Adjusted Prices for Inflation-Linked Bonds
**Author:** Paul Canty (Deutsche Bank, European Head of Inflation Trading) — *Risk*, January 2009.

This is a thorough working summary of the paper, written to be the canonical reference for the seasonal-adjustment math used across the Treasuries apps. Equation numbers match the paper. Where the apps depend on a result, the dependency is noted.

## 1. The problem the paper solves

Three things contaminate the price (and therefore the implied real yield / breakeven inflation) of an inflation-linked bond (ILB):

1. **Seasonality** ($S_t$) — periodic, recurrent CPI swings (clothing, accommodation, and in the US especially **motor fuel**). Reasonably stable in timing, direction and magnitude, so it can be modelled as a fixed set of 12 monthly factors that repeat every year.
2. **Carry** — the gap between the forward rate and the spot rate, driven largely by the **indexation lag** (3 months for TIPS / Canadian-style). Part of an ILB's "inflation protection" is *already-known historical* inflation, not a forward expectation.
3. **Outliers / one-off shocks** ($O_t$) — *known or expected* non-recurring events (a VAT hike, a gasoline move since the last CPI print). Distinct from seasonality (recurrent) and from noise (unforecastable).

Because these distort breakeven inflation (BEI = nominal yield − real yield), Canty argues you cannot meaningfully compare BEI levels, or the *steepness* of the real curve, without stripping them out. A 5y and a 10y react to seasonality **differently**, so even "how steep is the real curve?" is a seasonally-dependent question. The FOMC sidesteps this by quoting the **5y5y forward** (a whole number of years, so seasonality cancels); Canty's method removes the restriction by adjusting each individual bond.

The paper's scope is the **application** of seasonal factors, not their estimation (that is left to the statistical agencies / standard time-series methods).

## 1a. TIPS Translation: Canty's Notation → US TIPS Terms

Canty's paper uses generic notation for inflation-linked bonds across any market. For US TIPS, the variables map as follows:

| Canty notation | TIPS equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| $I_t$ — inflation index at date $t$ | **Ref CPI** on date $t$ | Non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U, daily-interpolated per 31 CFR § 356 App. B with a 3-month lag. A TIPS's adjusted principal = face value × (Ref CPI(t) / Ref CPI(dated date)), so the principal changes daily with the Ref CPI. |
| $I_{Base}$ — base index | **Ref CPI on the dated date** | Fixed at issuance; the inflation index ratio = Ref CPI(settle) / Ref CPI(dated date). This ratio multiplies the face value to give the current adjusted principal. |
| $I_{Settle}$ — index at settlement | **Ref CPI on the settlement date** | App. B interpolation for the specific day of the settlement month |
| $I_i$ — index at each payment date | **Ref CPI on each payment date** | Interpolated for the month/day of each semi-annual coupon and the final maturity |
| $T_t$ — trend component | **Ref CPI SA** on date $t$ | Because $S = \text{NSA}/\text{SA}$ and $I = T \times S$, the trend component is literally the daily-interpolated seasonally adjusted Ref CPI |
| $S_t$ — seasonal component | **SA Factor** on date $t$ | $\text{RefCPI}_{NSA}(t)\,/\,\text{RefCPI}_{SA}(t)$ — ratio of the two daily interpolated series |
| $C_i$ — real cashflows | Semi-annual coupon + principal | Coupon rate / 2 per payment period; 1 + coupon rate / 2 at maturity (per \$100 face, before inflation adjustment) |
| $CP$ — clean price | **Quoted real price** (clean price) | The price excluding inflation accrual, as quoted by FedInvest or brokers |
| $DP$ — dirty price | **Full price** | $CP \times \text{index ratio}$ (roughly) |
| $RAI$ — real accrued interest | Real accrued interest | Coupon accrued since last payment date, before inflation adjustment |
| $t_{Settle\text{-}lag}$ — settlement minus lag | 3 months before settlement | TIPS use a 3-month lag: the Ref CPI for any day in month $M$ interpolates between the CPI-U for months $M{-}3$ and $M{-}2$ |
| $I_{Base}$ at issuance / $RY$ | Dated Date Ref CPI / real yield | Published by Treasury at issuance; available in `TipsRef.csv` |

**Key points for TIPS:**

- **The 3-month lag.** The Ref CPI for any date in month $M$ is interpolated between the CPI-U (NSA) published for months $M-3$ and $M-2$. For example, a March 15 settlement uses the January and February CPI-U values interpolated for day 15 of a 31-day month.

- **No official daily SA Ref CPI.** BLS publishes monthly SA CPI-U alongside monthly NSA, but there is no official daily SA Ref CPI — daily interpolation officially applies to NSA only (it drives TIPS inflation accrual). The daily SA Ref CPI in `RefCpiNsaSa.csv` is constructed by applying the same App. B interpolation to the monthly CPI-SA series. It is a necessary calculated construct, not an official publication, and is used solely for seasonal yield comparison.

- **Trend component = SA Ref CPI.** Because the SA Factor $S = \text{NSA}/\text{SA}$ and the index decomposes as $I = T \times S$, the trend component $T$ is exactly the SA Ref CPI: $T = I / S = \text{NSA} / (\text{NSA}/\text{SA}) = \text{SA}$.

- **Semiannual vs annual.** Canty's Eq. 1–14 simplify to annual coupons; TIPS pay semi-annually. Eq. 17 handles two coupon months. As shown in spec [2.2](2.2_SAO_Residual_Analysis.md), the single-factor approximation (Eq. 14) is adequate for TIPS because the second-factor correction is ≤1 bp, driven by the small coupon stream while the principal cashflow (which dominates) falls in the maturity month in both formulas identically.

## 2. Index decomposition (the foundation)

The inflation index is decomposed multiplicatively:

$$I_t = T_t \, S_t \qquad (2)$$

- $T_t$ — **trend component** of the index (the underlying, deseasonalised inflation path).
- $S_t$ — **seasonal component** of the index for the calendar position of $t$ (repeats every 12 months; *constant over time* — the paper's key simplifying assumption).

> **App mapping.** In this project $S_t = \dfrac{\text{RefCPI}_{NSA}(t)}{\text{RefCPI}_{SA}(t)}$ — the ratio of the (App. B daily-interpolated) Non-Seasonally-Adjusted Ref CPI to the Seasonally-Adjusted Ref CPI. NSA $= T\cdot S$, SA $= T$, so their ratio isolates $S$. The daily SA series is a **calculated construct** (there is no official daily SA Ref CPI); see [1.0 Seasonal Adjustments](1.0_Seasonal_Adjustments.md) and `shared/src/ref-cpi.js`.

The fully-adjusted extension adds the outlier index (used only by FACP, §8):

$$I_t = T_t \, S_t \, O_t \qquad (20)$$

---

## 3. Derivation of the Seasonally Adjusted Clean Price (annual coupons)

Start from the **dirty price** of an ILB with annual real cashflows $C_i$ at times $t_i$ (nominal discount factor $df_i$, base index $I_{Base}$):

$$DP = \sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \frac{I_i}{I_{Base}} df_i \qquad (1)$$

Substitute the decomposition $I_i = T_i S_i$:

$$DP = \sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \frac{T_i S_i}{I_{Base}} df_i \qquad (3)$$

For **annual** coupons every $t_i$ falls on the same calendar month as maturity, so all $S_i$ are equal to $S_{Maturity}$ and factor out:

$$DP = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \frac{T_i}{I_{Base}} df_i\right) S_{Maturity} \qquad (4)$$

The bracket is the **seasonally adjusted dirty price** — it contains only trend inflation:

$$DP = SADP \times S_{Maturity} \quad\Rightarrow\quad SADP = \frac{DP}{S_{Maturity}} \qquad (5,6)$$

Convert dirty → clean using the clean-price definition (RAI = **real accrued interest**):

$$CP = \frac{I_{Base}}{I_{Settle}} DP - RAI \qquad (7)$$

Substitute (4), then decompose the settlement index a second time, $I_{Settle}=T_{Settle}S_{Settle}$:

$$CP = \frac{I_{Base}}{T_{Settle}S_{Settle}}\left(\sum_i C_i \frac{T_i}{I_{Base}} df_i\right) S_{Maturity} - RAI \qquad (8,9)$$

The $I_{Base}$ cancels and the trend ratio $T_i/T_{Settle}$ emerges:

$$CP = \left(\sum_i C_i \frac{T_i}{T_{Settle}} df_i\right)\frac{S_{Maturity}}{S_{Settle}} - RAI \qquad (10)$$

Define the **seasonally adjusted clean price** as the trend-only bracket minus RAI:

$$SACP \equiv \sum_i C_i \frac{T_i}{T_{Settle}} df_i - RAI \qquad (11)$$

Combining (10) and (11):

$$CP = (SACP + RAI)\frac{S_{Maturity}}{S_{Settle}} - RAI \qquad (12)$$

Solving for SACP gives the **exact relationship**:

$$\boxed{\,SACP = CP\,\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Maturity}} + RAI\left(\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Maturity}} - 1\right)\,} \qquad (13)$$

---

## 4. The working approximation (Eq 14) — what the apps use

When RAI is small relative to CP (TIPS coupons are low, typically ≤ 5%, paid semiannually) **and** $\left(\frac{S_{Maturity}}{S_{Settle}}-1\right)\approx 0$, the RAI term drops:

$$\boxed{\,SACP \approx CP\,\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Maturity}}\,} \qquad (14)$$

**This is the key result of the paper** and the transform implemented in `src/app.js` (`price × (saSettle / saMature)` → `yieldFromPrice`). The seasonally adjusted real yield is then just the ordinary YTM computed from SACP; seasonally adjusted BEI = nominal yield − SA real yield.

> **Anniversary identity (the crux for intuition).** When the maturity date is a whole number of years after settlement, settlement and maturity fall on the **same calendar month/day**, so $S_{Settle}=S_{Maturity}$, the ratio is **1.0, and SACP = CP — no adjustment at all.** The entire seasonal adjustment is therefore a function of the **stub**: the fractional-year offset between the settlement month/day and the maturity month/day. Over each whole year the seasonal pattern repeats and cancels; only the leftover partial year carries a net seasonal slope. Sliding the settlement date around the calendar sweeps this stub from 0 to a full year and traces the seasonal curve itself.

### What the ratio *means* economically
A TIPS's nominal inflation accrual from settlement to maturity is $\frac{I_{Mat}}{I_{Settle}} = \frac{T_{Mat}}{T_{Settle}}\cdot\frac{S_{Mat}}{S_{Settle}}$. The trend ratio is the "real" expected inflation; the seasonal ratio $\frac{S_{Mat}}{S_{Settle}}$ is a **predictable, calendar-driven** bump on top of it. So:

- **$S_{Mat} > S_{Settle}$** (buy in a low-factor month, mature in a high-factor month): you capture an extra slug of *seasonally guaranteed* nominal inflation. The market prices the bond **up** (lower quoted real yield). Eq 14 multiplies price by $\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Mat}}<1$ to **strip that gift out**.
- **$S_{Mat} < S_{Settle}$** (buy high, mature low): you forgo seasonal inflation; the market prices it **down** (higher quoted yield). Eq 14 multiplies by $\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Mat}}>1$ to **compensate**.

Thus the seasonal adjustment is fundamentally a correction to **expected nominal return** — it levels out the portion of return that is *seasonally predictable* so bonds maturing in different months compare on equal footing. (This framing is developed further in [2.0](2.0_SAO_Adjustment.md) §"Caveat" and [2.2](2.2_SAO_Residual_Analysis.md) §5.1, which note that other, *non*-seasonally-predictable factors may also move nominal return but cannot be modelled.)

### Why it works (empirical evidence in the paper)
- **Fig 3** (BTPS 1.65% 2008): the SA breakeven series is far less volatile and the April-2007 seasonal peak is largely removed.
- **Fig 4** (eurozone HICPx curve, Apr-2007): the raw BEI curve is wildly inverted at the short end; SA BEI is smooth and gently upward-sloping. A bond maturing in April barely moves under adjustment — because its maturity (April) is ~a whole number of years from the April settlement (the anniversary identity).
- **Fig 5** (UKTI 2.5% 2009, 8-month-lag gilt): seasonal adjustment explains most of the discontinuous "jump" in quoted yield at each new RPI release.

Uses Canty lists: historical BEI/real-yield analysis; plotting a BEI term structure across mixed maturity months; **relative-value** decisions (buy the July vs the September bond; 5y vs 10y); and **pricing new issues** in a maturity month with no comparable bond.

## 5. Semiannual coupons (Eq 15–19) — TIPS, BTPs, UK linkers

With semiannual coupons the cashflows fall in **two** calendar months, so there are two seasonal factors $S_1, S_2$ (the maturity month and the month six months away). The dirty price splits:

$$DP = \sum_{i\,\text{odd}} C_i \frac{T_i S_1}{I_{Base}} df_i + \sum_{i\,\text{even}} C_i \frac{T_i S_2}{I_{Base}} df_i \qquad (15)$$

Lacking the full discount curve for a single bond, approximate each seasonally-adjusted real discount factor by the bond's own real yield $RY$:

$$\frac{T_i}{I_{Base}} df_i \approx \frac{1}{(1+RY)^{t_i}} \qquad (16)$$

The SACP becomes a **real-discount-weighted blend** of the two factors:

$$SACP \approx CP\left(\frac{w_1\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_1} + w_2\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_2}}{w_1 + w_2}\right) \qquad (17)$$

$$w_1 = \sum_{i\,\text{odd}} \frac{C_i}{(1+RY)^{t_i}}, \qquad w_2 = \sum_{i\,\text{even}} \frac{C_i}{(1+RY)^{t_i}} \qquad (18,19)$$

> **App note.** The apps deliberately use the **single-factor Eq 14**, not Eq 17. Spec [2.2 §3.3](2.2_SAO_Residual_Analysis.md) tested Eq 17 against the live curve: it moves the worst outlier (2027-04) by **0.0 bp** and corrects at most **+1.1 bp** anywhere, only on high-coupon bonds — because the second-factor weight rides on the small *coupon* stream while the residual rides on the *principal*, which both formulas place in the maturity month identically. Eq 14 is therefore the right simplification.

## 6. The indexation lag and interpolation (Appendix A)

Most ILB markets index off a **3-month-lagged, daily-interpolated** CPI. For a settlement on day $d_1$ of a month with $d_2$ days:

$$I_{Interp} = I_1 + w\,(I_2 - I_1), \qquad w = 1 - \frac{d_1 - 1}{d_2}$$

where $I_1$ is the index three months prior to the settlement month and $I_2$ two months prior. (This is the 31 CFR App. B rule used throughout the project, defined once in `shared/src/ref-cpi.js`.) Canty notes the decomposition $I_{Interp}\approx T_{Interp}S_{Interp}$ is adequate because the cross-terms are negligible.

The forward index for a base date $t$ and forward date $T$:

$$I_T = I_t\,\frac{S_T}{S_t}\,\exp\!\big(r_{t,T}(T-t)\big)$$

with $r_{t,T}$ the continuously-compounded **trend** growth rate.

---

## 7. Seasonally adjusted forward prices (carry)

The lag means part of an ILB's inflation protection is **already-known history**, not a forward expectation. Between $t_{Settle-lag}$ and $t_{Settle}$ there have been one or two CPI prints, so some of the indexation is certain. To isolate the *market's forward expectation*, Canty computes the **forward price out to the furthest settlement date whose 3-month lag still references the latest known CPI print** (e.g. with the April CPI published mid-May, the furthest "known" forward settle is ~July 1; beyond that you'd need the unpublished May print). Apply the same seasonal adjustment as before, but using the **forward** nominal yield to that settlement date for the BEI. This strips the **carry** component out of breakeven comparisons.

---

## 8. Fully Adjusted Clean Price (FACP) & outliers (Eq 20–21)

To additionally remove a *known, non-recurring* shock, include the outlier index $O_t$ from (20). Example: an expected UK rate hike feeding the RPI mortgage component → $\{O_t\}=\{1.000,1.000,1.002,1.002,1.002\}$.

$$\boxed{\,FACP = CP\,\frac{S_{Settle}}{S_{Maturity}}\,\frac{1}{O_{Maturity}}\,} \qquad (21)$$

This is needed when significant non-seasonal items hit the short end — e.g. **TIPS gasoline volatility** since the last CPI print.

> **App note — "SAO" ≠ FACP.** This project's **SAO** step is *inspired by* Canty's outlier analysis but is **not** an implementation of $O_t$. Canty determines $O_t$ **analytically, per known event**; we cannot identify specific outlier events, so we instead **smooth the SA curve** with a Nelson-Siegel-Svensson fit and treat off-curve deviations as relative-value noise for a buy-and-hold holder. See [2.0](2.0_SAO_Adjustment.md) and [2.2](2.2_SAO_Residual_Analysis.md). **Do not conflate SAO with Canty's $O_t$.**

## Appendix B — Canty's illustrative seasonal factors

These are the paper's **example** factors (Table B), *not* the live US series. The real US CPI-NSA/SA factor used by the apps troughs in **late winter/early spring (Feb–Apr, ~0.994)** and peaks in **late summer/early autumn (Aug–Oct, ~1.0035)** — so US **April-maturity** TIPS sit near the seasonal trough and **October-maturity** near the peak (consistent with the residual signs in [2.2](2.2_SAO_Residual_Analysis.md)).

| Month | Multiplicative ($S$) | Additive (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| January | 0.996 | −0.5 |
| February | 0.996 | 0.0 |
| March | 1.001 | 0.5 |
| April | 1.003 | 0.2 |
| May | 1.003 | 0.0 |
| June | 1.004 | 0.1 |
| July | 1.000 | −0.4 |
| August | 0.999 | −0.1 |
| September | 1.000 | 0.1 |
| October | 1.000 | 0.0 |
| November | 0.999 | −0.1 |
| December | 1.001 | 0.2 |

*Key assumption throughout: the 12 monthly factors repeat unchanged every year (seasonality is periodic, recurrent, constant over time).*
