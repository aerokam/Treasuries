// segment-dara.js -- Shared (build + rebalance) per-year DARA segmentation helpers.
//
// Any number of "split years" partitions a ladder into consecutive segments the user manages
// on independent DARA targets — e.g. a near-term liability-matching stretch, then one or more
// tapering or speculative/heirs stretches beyond it. These helpers are pure range/map
// operations and are intentionally mode-agnostic: Build can reuse them as-is.
//
// The rebalance-only self-finance solve that computes a segment's "median" DARA lives in
// rebalance-lib.js (it depends on current holdings + net-cash → 0, which Build has no analog for).
// See 3.0 TIPS Ladder Rebalancing § Segmented DARA.

/**
 * Partition [firstYear, lastYear] at one or more split years into consecutive segments.

 * duplicates are collapsed. With no usable split years the whole ladder is a single segment.
 * @param {number|number[]} splitYears - one split year, or an array of them (any order).
 * @returns {Set<number>[]} segments in ascending year order, length = usable splits + 1.
