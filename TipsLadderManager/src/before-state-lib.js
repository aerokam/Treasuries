// answers a genuinely different question than the engine: "what does the portfolio already look
// like" (a plain holdings valuation), not "what should the portfolio become" (the engine's solved
// target). See top-level CLAUDE.md's single-source-of-truth rule for why these stay separate
// modules rather than one wrapping the other — they are two independent computations over the
// same holdings, not one duplicated copy of the other's math.
//
// It DOES reuse a couple of already-general, non-engine holdings-valuation helpers exported by
// rebalance-lib.js (`computePortfolioARAByYear`, `getGapYears`) — those never touch duration
// matching or self-financing, so reusing them is the single-source-of-truth rule working as
// intended, not a boundary violation.
