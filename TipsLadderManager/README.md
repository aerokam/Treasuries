# TIPS Ladder Manager

A free, browser-based tool for building and rebalancing [TIPS](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/marketable-securities/tips/) (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) ladders.

All calculations run locally in your browser — no data is uploaded anywhere.

## What It Does

**Rebalance** — for existing TIPS ladder holders rebalancing into newly issued TIPS. Assumes you want to keep using the same lower bracket TIPS you originally purchased.

**Build** — designs a new ladder from scratch with zero existing holdings.

## Traceability & Deep Drill

This tool is designed for **transparency first**. Every number in the UI is traceable to its source:
- **Level 1: UI Summary**: Actionable ladder totals and rung details.
- **Level 2: The Drill-Down**: Click any underlined value (Amount, Cost, etc.) to see the exact calculation chain.
- **Level 3: The Component Math**: Click nested variables within popups (like **Index Ratio** or **Ref CPI**) to see the underlying interpolation math and official formulas.
- **Level 4: Legal Authority**: Deep-links to the **Code of Federal Regulations (31 CFR § 356)** are provided within math popups for institutional-grade verification.

## Key Concepts

**TIPS** — Treasury Inflation Protected Securities: Treasury notes and bonds whose principal adjusts daily with inflation as measured by CPI-U. Coupon interest is paid semi-annually, and is calculated based on the inflation-adjusted principal. At maturity you receive the inflation-adjusted principal plus the final coupon payment. All amounts shown in the application are in *real* (inflation-adjusted, today's dollars) terms.

**TIPS Ladder** — A portfolio of TIPS maturing in successive years, which along with the semi-annual interest payments, provides a predictable inflation-adjusted amount each year throughout the ladder period.

**DARA (Desired Annual Real Amount)** — Your desired annual real amount from the ladder. Each rung is sized to produce this amount.

**Gap Years** — Years within the current TIPS timeline (e.g. 2037–2039) where Treasury has not issued securities. These are covered by holding excess bonds in surrounding *bracket* years to match the average duration of the missing maturities.

**Future Years** — Years beyond the currently issued TIPS (e.g. 2057–2066). Like gap years, these are handled via duration-matched excess in existing long-dated cover pairs (currently the 2052 and 2056 TIPS).

**Bracket Years** — Maturity years used to cover gaps or future years. *Upper bracket*: always the Feb 2040 TIPS. *Lower bracket*: usually the latest 10-year TIPS before the gap. In **3-bracket mode**, the tool uses both your original lower holdings and a second "new lower" bracket for more efficient matching.

**Role Playing (LMI)** — When bracket or cover TIPS of a given maturity substitute for TIPS that haven't yet been issued (gap years or future 30-year rungs), they "role play" by contributing their annual interest to the funded year amount for that maturity. Example: If excess Feb 2056s are held to cover future 30-year rungs (e.g., 2057–2066), the interest from those excess 2056 TIPS contributes to the 2056 funded year amount, which could reduce the quantity of 2056 TIPS required for the 2056 funded year.

| Data | Source | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| TIPS prices & yields | FedInvest (TreasuryDirect) | Daily ~1 PM ET, Mon–Fri |
| Reference CPI | BLS (via TreasuryDirect) | Monthly |
