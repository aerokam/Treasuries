# R2 Bucket Cleanup Audit

Audit run 2026-04-30. Cleanup executed 2026-05-21.

**Background:** Gradual migration from `TIPS/` → `Treasuries/` prefix left many scripts writing to both locations; only one location was read. Cleanup completed — orphan writes patched, dead objects deleted.

**2026-09-02 follow-up:** `Treasuries/TipsRef.csv` was on the delete list but survived (frozen at 2026-07-13, still resolving, missing every TIPS issued since — it broke a spot-curve verification). Now deleted, and the last links to it fixed (`DataStores.md` S2, the TLM pipeline diagram, the Dashboard staleness monitor). `scripts/r2-cleanup.js` has itself been **removed**: it was a one-time script whose `KEYS_TO_DELETE` list went stale and had grown to include keys that are now live (`TIPS/RefCpiNsaSa.csv`, `TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv`) — re-running it would have destroyed production data.

### R2 objects deleted (30 objects via `scripts/r2-cleanup.js`)

**Orphan writes (were written every pipeline run, never read):**
- `Treasuries/RefCPI.csv`
- `TIPS/Auctions.csv`
- `TIPS/YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv`
- `TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv` — **misclassified; see correction below**
- `TIPS/yield-history/*_history.json` (14 files)

**Stale legacy (no current reader or writer):**
- `TIPS/Yields.csv` (old filename, last written 2026-04-03)
- `TIPS/TipsYields.csv` (2026-03-24)
- `Treasuries/TipsYields.csv` (2026-03-25)
- `Treasuries/RefCpiNsaSa.csv` (migration artifact — canonical is `TIPS/RefCpiNsaSa.csv`)

**Audit clarification items:**
- `misc/TIPS_SAO.csv` — no code references, deleted
- `misc/BondMarketHolidays.csv` — old pre-SIFMA file, only referenced in external Bogleheads spreadsheet, deleted
- `bls/CpiReleaseSchedule2024.csv` — year expired, deleted

**TipsRef consolidation:**
- `Treasuries/TipsRef.csv` — consolidated to `TIPS/TipsRef.csv`; browser app updated accordingly

## Correction (2026-06-01)

`TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv` was **wrongly classified as an orphan** above. It is read by no
*app*, but it is a deliberate **public resource** — published so people can pull market
SA/SAO TIPS yields into their own spreadsheets. The upload in
`YieldCurves/scripts/updateSaSaoYields.js` has been restored and the file is written
to `TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv` on every Fidelity broker-quote run. Do not remove it.

Separately, that run was logging `Exited with code 1` even on success: the script wrote
its progress via `console.error`, and `run-fidelity.cmd`'s `2>&1` pipe makes PowerShell 5.1
wrap any native stderr as a `NativeCommandError` and flip the exit code. Progress logging
was moved to `console.log` (stdout); `console.error` + `exit(1)` is now reserved for real
failures only.

## Correction (2026-07-19)

`fidelityDownload.js` was changed (~2026-06-23) to download one combined
`FidelityTreasuriesTips.csv` (Treasury + TIPS rows in a single export, split by a
`Product` column) instead of two separate files, and `uploadFidelityDownload.js` was
updated to upload only the combined file to `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuriesTips.csv`.
The old R2 keys `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuries.csv` and `Treasuries/FidelityTips.csv`
stopped being written at that point, but several consumers kept reading them directly
and were never repointed at the combined file:

- **Admin Dashboard** (`Dashboard/server.js`, `Dashboard/index.html`) — two pipeline
  rows/nodes (`broker-nominals`/`S7a`, `broker-tips`/`S7b`) monitored the dead keys, so
  the dashboard silently showed ~1-month-stale data instead of flagging staleness (the
  keys still existed in R2 from before the cutover, just frozen). Consolidated to one
  `broker-quotes`/`S7` pipeline pointing at `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuriesTips.csv`.
- **FundHoldings** (`FundHoldings/enrichHoldings.js`) — fetched
  `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuries.csv` directly for nominal Ask Yield/Coupon enrichment,
  so nominal fund holdings (e.g. VBIL) were enriched from a frozen June 23 snapshot for
  about a month. Repointed at the combined file, filtering to non-TIPS rows by `Product`.

`YieldCurves/src/app.js` itself was already reading the combined file correctly — it was
not affected.

**Old keys to delete** (superseded, no longer written by any script):
- `Treasuries/FidelityTreasuries.csv`
- `Treasuries/FidelityTips.csv`

See [DataStores.md#s7](./DataStores.md#s7) and [DATA_DICTIONARY.md#s7](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#s7) for the current combined-file schema.

## Correction (2026-08-24)

`TIPS/tentative_tips.json` was a derived JSON extract of TIPS-only entries from the Tentative Auction Schedule XML, generated and uploaded by `scripts/updateTentativeSchedule.js` alongside the full XML mirror. It was never read by any app: `TreasuryAuctions/src/app.js` declared a `TENTATIVE_TIPS_URL` constant pointing at it but never fetched it, instead cross-referencing TIPS status client-side from the full XML mirror's own `TIPS` field. Removed the JSON generation/upload from `updateTentativeSchedule.js`, the dead constant from `app.js`, and the R2 object.

S9 in [DataStores.md](./DataStores.md#s9), [Portal.md](./Portal.md), and [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#s9) previously pointed at this dead JSON file; it now correctly documents `TIPS/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`, the file the app actually reads (which had no data-store entry of its own before this correction).

Also removed `TreasuryAuctions/data/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml` and `TreasuryAuctions/data/tentative_tips.json` from git tracking and added `TreasuryAuctions/data/` to `.gitignore`: these were the script's local staging copies written before upload, not consumed by any app — R2 is the sole source apps read at runtime.

## Correction (2026-09-07)

Two objects the 2026-05-21 cleanup listed for deletion were still in the bucket, frozen at 2026-07-13: `TIPS/Auctions.csv` and `TIPS/YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv`. Both were orphan writes, superseded by the `Treasuries/` copies every script and app already read. Deleted, and the deletion verified by fetching each key afterwards and confirming a 404 rather than assuming the delete took — the same failure that left `Treasuries/TipsRef.csv` behind.

`Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml` moved from the `TIPS/` prefix to `Treasuries/`. It was never duplicated or stale, and every spec and code path agreed on the old location; it was misfiled by category. The schedule covers every auction type and merely carries a `TIPS` field marking which are TIPS, so it is Treasury-wide data rather than TIPS data.

Order followed, since this one was live: copy to the new key; repoint the writer (`scripts/updateTentativeSchedule.js`), the reader (`TreasuryAuctions/src/app.js`), the Dashboard monitor, and the specs; run the writer end to end and confirm it published 74,558 bytes to the new key; only then delete the old key and confirm the 404.

`scripts/migrateR2.js` was **not** used and should not be reused as it stands: it copies everything under `TIPS/` to `Treasuries/` with no filtering and no source deletion, which would duplicate the TIPS-specific stores that correctly live under `TIPS/` and recreate exactly the cross-prefix confusion this entry records.

## Correction (2026-09-07, second)

`Treasuries/yield-history/` (**singular**) held 29 objects, all frozen at 2026-06-09: fourteen per-symbol `<SYM>_history.json` files, fourteen `intraday-raw/` days, and one `close-probe/` file. 2026-06-09 is the date commit `28751ca` retired the per-symbol model and renamed the prefix to `Treasuries/yields-history/` (**plural**), so nothing had written to the singular prefix since. All 29 deleted, each verified by fetching the key afterwards and confirming a 404.

The two prefixes differ by one letter and sort next to each other in a bucket listing, and the plural one contains `intraday-raw/`, which gains a file per symbol per weekday. The stale dates under the singular prefix were therefore read as a broken scheduled job twice before the cause was found. It was never broken.

Every live writer already used the plural prefix (`updateYieldsHistory.js`, `archiveIntraday.js`, `probeClose.js`, `probeLock.js`). The single remaining reference to the singular prefix was `fetchLegacySeries()` in `updateYieldsHistory.js`, a one-time migration seed that could no longer fire — it ran only for a symbol with no accumulated history, and every symbol has some. Removed with its call site.
