**Update Frequency**: Monthly (on BLS release).
**R2 Key**: `TIPS/RefCpiNsaSa.csv`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Ref CPI Date` | Date | The specific date for the Ref CPI values. |

## <a id="s6"></a>S6: yields-history/
**Description**: Single consolidated JSON, nested by symbol (US10Y, US30Y, … — all 14).
**Update Frequency**: Weekdays (end-of-day snapshots) via `updateYieldsHistory.js`.

**Format**: one object keyed by symbol, each value a `{ x, y }` array, e.g. `{ "US10Y": [ { "x": "20260403150000", "y": 4.25 }, ... ], "US30Y": [ ... ], ... }`.
- `x` is CNBC's compact `tradeTime` string `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` (no separators). Daily-close bars are stamped at 15:00 ET (`...150000`) — the ~3PM benchmark close (see `YieldsMonitor/knowledge/Close_Price_Investigation.md`).
- `y` is the yield as a number (percent, `%` stripped).

**Refresh logic**: `updateYieldsHistory.js` rereads the 1Y/2Y/3Y daily feeds and merges the coarser 10Y/ALL feeds, skipping the current (provisional) ET day, and rewrites the whole file. One daily 3PM close per completed trading day per symbol. The browser stitches live intraday on top of this daily baseline. (Replaces the retired per-symbol `snapHistory.js` append model.)

## <a id="s13"></a>S13: YieldCurves.csv
**Description**: General-purpose, spreadsheet-ready yields — evaluated yields for every priced Treasury (Bill/Note/Bond/STRIPS) and TIPS security, plus the fitted nominal, TIPS-quoted and TIPS-SA zero-coupon (spot) yield curves evaluated on a term grid (unlike [S12](#s12), which stores unevaluated Svensson parameters). Renamed from `SpotYieldCurves.csv` (2026-09-07): the file is a general yields resource, not spot-curves-only — it also carries every quoted security's own Ask/SA/SAO yield. Superseded the parameters-only `SpotYieldCurves.json` (retired 2026-09-07): six coefficients aren't usable in a spreadsheet, so this file stores actual yields instead. One row per **actual security** (`CUSIP`/`Maturity`/`Type` populated; `Ask`/`SA`/`SAO` populated where they exist) or one row per **fitted grid point** (`CUSIP` = `Spot`, `Maturity` blank, `Type` = `Treasury`/`TIPS`/`BEI`; `Spot`/`Spot SA` populated per Type — see below).
**Update Frequency**: Chained, not independently scheduled — re-run whenever either of its actual inputs changes: after `FidelityQuotes` (3x daily on weekdays, via `run-fidelity.cmd`) and after `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices` (1x daily on weekdays, via `run-fedinvest.cmd`), each chaining into `YieldCurves/scripts/run-yield-curves.cmd` on success. See [Data_Pipeline.md](./Data_Pipeline.md).
**R2 Key**: `Treasuries/YieldCurves.csv`

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Term (y)` | Number | Years from settlement to maturity (actual security row), or the grid horizon (fitted row). |
| `Maturity` | Date | Maturity date. Blank on a fitted grid row. |
| `CUSIP` | String | 9-character security identifier on a security row. `Spot` on a fitted grid row, so a grid row reads consistently with a security row rather than leaving the field blank. |
| `Type` | String | Security row: `Bill`, `Note`, `Bond`, `STRIPS`, or `TIPS` ([Treasury CUSIP Reference](./Treasury_CUSIP_Reference.md)). Grid row: `Treasury` (fitted nominal spot), `TIPS` (fitted TIPS quoted + SA spot), or `BEI` (nominal spot minus TIPS spot) — three rows per term per source. |
| `Source` | String | `FedInvest` or `Market`, same distinction as [S10](#s10)/[S14](#s14)/[S15](#s15). |
| `Ask` | Number | Ask yield-to-maturity (decimal). Security rows only. FedInvest carries a single mid-market yield ([E1](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e1)), not a true ask — this column holds that mid-market figure on FedInvest-source rows. STRIPS rows carry Fidelity's own reported ask yield-to-maturity, the same pass-through convention already used for every other nominal Treasury Market row (see the STRIPS note below). |
| `SA` | Number | [SA Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sa-yield) (decimal). TIPS security rows only. |
| `SAO` | Number | [SAO Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sao-yield) (decimal). TIPS security rows only. |
| `Spot` | Number | Grid rows only, semi-annual bond-equivalent decimal (converted from the module's continuously-compounded `z(t)` so it sits on the same basis as `Ask`). Type `Treasury`: fitted nominal Treasury zero-coupon yield at `Term (y)`. Type `TIPS`: fitted TIPS zero-coupon yield to the **quoted** (non-SA) ask prices. Type `BEI`: nominal spot minus TIPS quoted spot. |
| `Spot SA` | Number | Grid rows only. Type `TIPS`: fitted TIPS zero-coupon yield to seasonally adjusted prices. Type `BEI`: nominal spot minus TIPS SA spot, per [4.0 Spot Yield Curves](../YieldCurves/knowledge/3.4_Spot_Yield_Curves.md#spot-bei). Blank on Type `Treasury` (no SA concept for a nominal). |

**STRIPS**: `Product = Treasury` in [S7](#s7)/[E6](#e6) also covers STRIPS (zero-coupon, identified by CUSIP root, e.g. `912803`/`912820`/`912821`/`912833`/`912834` — [Treasury CUSIP Reference](./Treasury_CUSIP_Reference.md)), a fact neither S7 nor E6 states explicitly today (both describe `Product` as Treasury-or-TIPS with no mention that STRIPS rows sit inside the Treasury rows — flagged as a documentation gap, not yet fixed). STRIPS are Market-source only (not present in FedInvest data as of 2026-09). They are excluded from the nominal spot-curve fit's input universe, same as every other STRIP-fitting exclusion in this pipeline, but included as their own `Type = STRIPS` security rows, with `Ask` taken directly from Fidelity's reported yield — the same trusted pass-through already used for every other nominal Treasury Market row (Bills/Notes/Bonds also read `Ask` straight from Fidelity rather than recomputing it here), so no coupon-bond formula is applied to a STRIP's zero-coupon price by this pipeline.

**Term grid**: half-year steps (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, …), matching the chart's own `spotCurveGrid` convention and including every whole year in range (a whole-year term is itself a half-year multiple, so no separate annual pass is needed). Spans the union of the nominal, TIPS-quoted and TIPS-SA fits' valid ranges per `Source`, rather than clipping to their intersection — a term outside one curve's valid range simply leaves that curve's cell(s) blank rather than dropping the whole row. A cell is also left blank if its fit's sanity check fails at that term (see `shared/src/spot-curve.js#spotCurveFit`).

**Logic**: Loads the same R2 inputs the YieldCurves app loads (S1, S4, S7, `misc/BondHolidaysSifma.csv`) and fits with `shared/src/spot-curve.js#spotCurveFit` — the same module `src/app.js` imports, so the app and this pipeline can never drift onto two different fits. The script evaluates the fit objects' own `z(t)`/`sane()` on the term grid rather than refitting.

## <a id="s14"></a>S14: BreakevenInflation.csv
**Description**: Per-TIPS breakeven inflation — the Ask/SA/SAO yield for each TIPS against the yield of its nearest-maturity nominal Treasury, `Market` (broker quotey) source only. Matches the YieldCurves BEI tab's per-bond table, which the app computes but does not persist.
**Update Frequency**: `Market`-only data, so it changes only when `FidelityQuotes` refreshes (3x daily on weekdays); written by the same chained `updateSpotYieldCurves.js` run as [S13](#s13) (also chained from `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices`, which this file doesn't depend on — see [Data_Pipeline.md](./Data_Pipeline.md)).
**R2 Key**: `Treasuries/BreakevenInflation.csv`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cusip` | String | TIPS CUSIP. |
| `maturity` | Date | TIPS maturity date. |
| `coupon` | Number | Real coupon rate (decimal). |
| `ask_yield` | Number | Ask yield-to-maturity (decimal). |
| `sa_yield` | Number | [SA Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sa-yield). |
| `sao_yield` | Number | [SAO Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sao-yield). |
| `nominal_cusip` | String | CUSIP of the nearest-maturity nominal Treasury. |
| `nominal_maturity` | Date | That nominal's maturity date. |
| `nominal_yield` | Number | That nominal's ask yield-to-maturity (decimal). |
| `ask_bei` | Number | `nominal_yield − ask_yield`. |
| `sa_bei` | Number | `nominal_yield − sa_yield`. |
| `sao_bei` | Number | `nominal_yield − sao_yield`. |

## <a id="s15"></a>S15: BidAskSpreads.csv
**Description**: Per-security broker bid/ask yield and price spread, TIPS and nominal Treasuries combined in one file (`security_type` discriminates, same pattern as [S7](#s7)'s `Product` column). `Market` (broker quotey) source only — FedInvest carries a single mid-market price, not a separate bid and ask.
**Update Frequency**: `Market`-only data, so it changes only when `FidelityQuotes` refreshes (3x daily on weekdays); written by the same chained `updateSpotYieldCurves.js` run as [S13](#s13) (also chained from `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices`, which this file doesn't depend on — see [Data_Pipeline.md](./Data_Pipeline.md)).
**R2 Key**: `Treasuries/BidAskSpreads.csv`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `security_type` | String | `TIPS` or `Treasury`. |
| `cusip` | String | 9-character security identifier. |
| `maturity` | Date | Maturity date. |
| `coupon` | Number | Coupon rate (decimal). |
| `ask_yield` | Number | Ask yield-to-maturity (decimal). |
| `bid_yield` | Number | Bid yield-to-maturity (decimal). |
| `yield_spread_bps` | Number | `(bid_yield − ask_yield) × 10000`. |
| `ask_price` | Number | Ask price (TIPS: raw clean price, matching S7). |
| `bid_price` | Number | Bid price (TIPS: raw clean price, matching S7). |
| `price_spread_pct` | Number | TIPS: `(adjusted_ask − adjusted_bid) / adjusted_ask × 100` (actual dollar cost). Treasury: `(ask − bid) / ask × 100`. |

## <a id="s8"></a>S8: CPI_history.csv
**Description**: Full monthly BLS CPI-U history (NSA and SA) from January 1913 to present.
**Update Frequency**: Monthly (on BLS release).
**R2 Key**: `bls/CPI_history.csv`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Year` | String | 4-digit year (e.g., `"1913"`) |
| `Period` | String | BLS period code (e.g., `"M01"` = January) |
| `PeriodName` | String | Full month name (e.g., `"January"`) |
| `NSA` | Number | CPI-U Not Seasonally Adjusted ([E4](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e4) series `CUUR0000SA0`) |
| `SA` | Number | CPI-U Seasonally Adjusted ([E4](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e4) series `CUSR0000SA0`). Blank for periods before January 1947. |

**Sort order**: Ascending by Year, then Period (oldest row first).

## <a id="s9"></a>S9: Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml
**Description**: Copy of the Treasury's Tentative Auction Schedule, used to identify TIPS auctions that the FiscalData upcoming-auctions feed doesn't flag.
**Update Frequency**: Local Windows Task `TreasuryAuctions-TentativeSchedule`. Treasury revises this schedule at its Quarterly Refunding press conference (first Wednesday of Feb/May/Aug/Nov), with the document itself updated ~1–3 weeks later, so the task runs daily for 21 days after each of the next 2 quarterly-refunding dates, plus a monthly safety-net check the rest of the year. A companion task, `TreasuryAuctions-TentativeSchedule-Refresh`, re-runs `scripts/setup-tentative-schedule-task.ps1` quarterly to roll the trigger window forward — no manual maintenance needed.
**R2 Key**: `Treasuries/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`

**Format**: XML `<AuctionCalendarDate>` elements, each with `AuctionDate`, `SecurityTermWeekYear`, `SecurityType`, `ReOpeningIndicator` (Y/N), `TIPS` (Y/N), `FloatingRate` (Y/N), `AnnouncementDate`, `SettlementDate`.

**Logic**: Fetched directly by the TreasuryAuctions app, which matches each upcoming-auction row to an `<AuctionCalendarDate>` node by `AuctionDate` + `SecurityTermWeekYear` and flags it TIPS if that node's `TIPS` field is `Y`.

## <a id="s10"></a>S10: YieldsSaSao.csv
**Description**: TIPS ask/SA/SAO yields derived from the market quotes in [S7](#s7).
**Update Frequency**: Triggered by the `FidelityQuotes` task (3× daily on weekdays), via `updateSaSaoYields.js`.
**R2 Key**: `TIPS/YieldsSaSao.csv`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cusip` | String | 9-character security identifier. |
| `maturity` | Date | Maturity date. |
| `coupon` | Number | Real coupon rate (decimal). |
| `ask_yield` | Number | Ask yield-to-maturity (decimal). |
| `sa_yield` | Number | [SA Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sa-yield). |
| `sao_yield` | Number | [SAO Yield](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#sao-yield). |

**Consumer**: FundHoldings ([E7](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e7)/[E8](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e8) holdings enrichment) — cross-references by CUSIP to attach ask/SA/SAO yield to TIPS fund holdings.

## <a id="s11"></a>S11: FundHoldings/Holdings-&lt;TICKER&gt;(-Enriched).csv
**Description**: Treasury and TIPS fund holdings by CUSIP, one raw and one enriched CSV per fund ticker (VBIL, VTIP, VTP, RBIL, LTPZ, SCHP, XHLF, ICPI). The enriched file adds ask/SA/SAO yield, term, and duration, computed the same way for every fund from [S10](#s10) and [S7](#s7) rather than taken from each provider’s own reported analytics.
**Update Frequency**: Daily, Local Windows Task `FundHoldings`, via `FundHoldings/updateAllHoldings.js` then `FundHoldings/enrichHoldings.js`.
**R2 Key**: `FundHoldings/` (its own top-level prefix, since a fund’s holdings mix TIPS and nominal rows and so belong under neither `TIPS/` nor `Treasuries/`)

**CSV columns** (exact header names): `CUSIP, Holding Name, Ticker, Category, Quantity, Coupon, % of Fund, Market Value, Maturity Date, ISIN, SEDOL, As of` — and, in the `-Enriched` file only, `Ask Yield, SA Yield, SAO Yield, Term, Duration`. These are the file’s own headers; the [E7](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e7)–[E12](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e12) entries name the same fields in the Data Dictionary’s normalized form.

**Companion file**: `FundHoldings/FundMeta.json` = `{ @Ticker: { fundName, portId | etfId | cusip | portfolioId, expenseRatio, secYield } }`. `expenseRatio` and `secYield` are percent-scale numbers (`0.09` for 0.09%), each the provider’s own reported figure rather than an independently computed one.

**Sources**: [E7](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e7) Vanguard, [E8](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e8) fminvest.com, [E9](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e9) PIMCO, [E10](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e10) Schwab, [E11](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e11) BondBloxx, [E12](./DATA_DICTIONARY.md#e12) BlackRock iShares.

## <a id="s12"></a>S12: GswTipsCurve.json
**Description**: The latest published row of the Federal Reserve's Gürkaynak-Sack-Wright fitted TIPS (real) yield curve (FEDS 2008-05), scraped from `feds200805_1.html`. Just the six Svensson parameters and the observation date — the app evaluates the curve itself. Used only as a reference overlay against YieldCurves' own spot fit.
**Update Frequency**: `GswTipsCurve` task, daily 7:15am PT, via `YieldCurves/scripts/updateGswTipsCurve.js`. The source itself updates weekly (Tuesdays, covering through the prior Friday); the daily poll just picks up new or revised rows promptly.
**R2 Key**: `TIPS/GswTipsCurve.json`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `date` | Date | Observation date of the fitted curve (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `beta0`–`beta3` | Number | Svensson level / slope / two curvature coefficients (percent). |
| `tau1`, `tau2` | Number | Svensson decay parameters (years). |

**Consumer**: YieldCurves (TIPS tab) — evaluates the Svensson zero-yield formula from these parameters to draw the "GSW zero" reference line.
