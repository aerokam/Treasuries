## 2.0 Ingestion Jobs (Ownership & Schedule)

All ingestion jobs have been migrated to **Local Windows Scheduled Tasks** to ensure precision and reliability.

### [LOCAL] Local Scheduled Tasks (Windows)
These jobs run on the host machine via Windows Task Scheduler.

| Task Name | Schedule | Script | Primary Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **FedInvest Download** | Weekdays 1:05pm ET, retries every 10 min up to 2h if not yet posted | `scripts/getYieldsFedInvest.js` (via `YieldCurves/scripts/run-fedinvest.cmd`) | `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices.csv` |
| **Fidelity Quotes** | 3× Daily | *(Windows Task)* | `FidelityTreasuriesTips.csv` (combined Treasury + TIPS) |
| **TreasuryAuctions** | Weekdays 8:35/10:05am PT | `scripts/getAuctions.js` | `Auctions.csv` |
| **TIPS Ref Refresh** | Mondays 7am PT | `scripts/fetchTipsRef.js` | `TipsRef.csv` |
| **Update Yields History** | Weekdays 2:00pm PT | `YieldsMonitor/scripts/updateYieldsHistory.js` | `yields-history/history.json` |
| **SA Factor Update** | Daily 6:35am | `YieldCurves/scripts/updateRefCpi.js` | `RefCpiNsaSa.csv` |
| **FundHoldings** | Daily 6:40am PT | `FundHoldings/updateAllHoldings.js`, then `FundHoldings/enrichHoldings.js` | `FundHoldings/Holdings-<TICKER>(-Enriched).csv` and `FundHoldings/FundMeta.json` ([S11](./DataStores.md#s11)) |
| **GSW TIPS Curve** | Daily 7:15am PT | `YieldCurves/scripts/updateGswTipsCurve.js` | `TIPS/GswTipsCurve.json` (GSW Svensson params — [S12](./DataStores.md#s12)) |
| **Yield Curves** | Chained after BOTH inputs it depends on: `FidelityQuotes` (3x daily on weekdays, via `run-fidelity.cmd`) and `YieldsFromFedInvestPrices` (1x daily on weekdays, via `run-fedinvest.cmd`), each calling `run-yield-curves.cmd` on success. No standalone trigger. | `YieldCurves/scripts/updateSpotYieldCurves.js` (via `YieldCurves/scripts/run-yield-curves.cmd`) | `Treasuries/YieldCurves.csv` ([S13](./DataStores.md#s13)), `Treasuries/BreakevenInflation.csv` ([S14](./DataStores.md#s14)), `Treasuries/BidAskSpreads.csv` ([S15](./DataStores.md#s15)) |
| **CPI History Refresh** | 8:35 AM ET on each BLS release date, then chains Ref CPI Refresh | `scripts/fetchCpiHistory.js` (`run-cpi-history.cmd`) | `bls/CPI_history.csv` |
| **Ref CPI Refresh** | Chained from CPI History Refresh (not independently scheduled) | `scripts/fetchRefCpi.js` (`run-ref-cpi.cmd`) | `TIPS/RefCPI.csv` |

**CPI release date triggers:** the `CpiHistory` task uses date-specific `Once` triggers (not a daily poll). Triggers are set by `scripts/setup-windows-tasks.ps1`, the single script that registers every local task (see also rows above) — it reads `bls/CpiReleaseSchedule{year}.csv` from R2 and registers one trigger per release date. On each firing, `run-cpi-history.cmd` fetches BLS CPI history, then on success chains straight into `run-ref-cpi.cmd` to fetch Ref CPI from TreasuryDirect — `RefCpi` has no scheduled trigger of its own, since TreasuryDirect's Ref CPI is a separate source that lags the BLS release by an unknown amount and chaining runs it as soon as the BLS fetch confirms the release is out, rather than on a fixed guessed offset. `fetchRefCpi.js --write` checks the freshly-fetched data against the coverage implied by the just-fetched BLS month (last day of month+2) and exits non-zero if TreasuryDirect hasn't caught up yet; the `CpiHistory` task is configured to retry every 30 minutes, up to 12 times (6 hours), on failure. A `CpiTasks` task runs Dec 29 each year to reload the next year's schedule and self-reschedule. Re-run `scripts/setup-windows-tasks.ps1` manually if the schedule changes.

## 3.0 R2 Data Store
All jobs above upload their results to the central Cloudflare R2 bucket (`pub-ba11062b177640459f72e0a88d0261ae.r2.dev`).
- **Reference**: See [DataStores.md](./DataStores.md) for the full file manifest and live previews.

### 3.1 Browser Read Access (CORS)
Every app (TipsLadderManager, YieldCurves, Primer, YieldsMonitor, CpiExplorer, FundHoldings, TreasuryAuctions, SeasonalAdjustments, TipsReference, etc.) reads from this one bucket via browser `fetch()`. R2 buckets ship with **no CORS policy by default** — a bucket with no policy configured rejects all cross-origin browser reads regardless of origin (confirmed live May 9, 2026, commit `55f67f4`: "R2 bucket lacks CORS headers, making it inaccessible from browser").

Sometime after that, the bucket's CORS policy was configured manually in the Cloudflare dashboard (no wrangler/IaC file in this repo manages it) with a literal 3-origin allowlist — not a wildcard, not a pattern:
- `http://localhost:8080` — local dev, main branch
- `http://localhost:8081` — local dev, worktree branch
- `https://aerokam.github.io` — production (GitHub Pages)

Verified live 2026-08-03 by sending various `Origin` headers and checking for an echoed `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. Any other origin is rejected, including `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (a distinct origin from `localhost:8080` even on the same port) and any other localhost port.

**Practical effect**: run the main-branch dev server on `localhost:8080` and a worktree dev server on `localhost:8081` (always `localhost`, never `127.0.0.1`) — both already have live R2 access. A third concurrent local server needs its origin added to the bucket's CORS policy first (Cloudflare dashboard → R2 → bucket → Settings → CORS Policy), or its R2 fetches will silently fail.
