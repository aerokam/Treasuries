<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Registers all Treasuries data pipeline tasks in Windows Task Scheduler.
.DESCRIPTION
    Creates one scheduled task per ingestion job. Re-running is safe (idempotent  - 
    existing tasks are unregistered and re-created).

    CPI tasks use date-specific triggers fetched live from R2. All other tasks use
    weekly or daily recurring triggers.

    All times are Pacific Time (PT). ET-based tasks run 5 minutes after their ET
    anchor. ET and PT observe DST together so the offset is always -3h.
    If your machine is NOT in Pacific Time, adjust all times below.
.PARAMETER ProjectDir
    Treasuries project root. Defaults to the parent of this script's directory.
