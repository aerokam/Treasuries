// separate "near-maturity simple discounting" convention for coupon-bearing TIPS/notes/
// bonds (a prior version had one, decided by days-to-maturity alone; it both broke when
// settle landed within a day of an INTERMEDIATE, non-final coupon — surfaced by
// YieldsMonitor's SA historical reconstruction sweeping settle across every calendar
// day — and diverged from priceFromYield, which never had that special case).
