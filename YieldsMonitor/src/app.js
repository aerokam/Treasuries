// Seasonal Adjustment (SA) — see YieldCurves/knowledge/3.2_Seasonal_Adjustments.md.
// CNBC's TIPS symbols (e.g. US2YTIPS) are the bid yield of one specific, real TIPS —
// CNBC's own quote page shows which one (e.g. US2YTIPS = the Jan 2028 0.50% TIPS).
// So this is the exact same transform YieldCurves applies to actual TIPS: derive the
// clean price from the quoted yield via standard bond math using the bond's REAL
// coupon and maturity date, apply the Price -> SA Price -> SA Yield ratio, and derive
// the SA yield back from the adjusted price.
// The seasonal effect amortizes with maturity (see YieldCurves/knowledge/
// SAO_Residual_Analysis.md) — by 10Y/30Y it's at or below noise level, so the SA
// line there will sit almost on top of the raw line. It's still offered at all five
// TIPS maturities for curve completeness (the Yield Curves/BEI tabs otherwise show a
// visibly incomplete curve past 5Y).
//
// Bond identity — today vs. history:
// CNBC's restQuote endpoint (fetchTipsBondMeta) only exposes each symbol's CURRENT
// underlying bond, not a historical CUSIP-per-date mapping — so it's used as the
// authoritative source for TODAY's point only. For every other (historical) point,
// the bond identity comes from SA_ROLLOVER_LOG below: an empirically OBSERVED record
// of which maturity each symbol actually quoted, not a predicted one. A calendar rule
// ("rolls every 6 months, on the 15th of the origin-auction month, always the same
// family") was tried and falsified twice: not just a variable lag after the checkpoint,
// but sometimes a different origin-auction family altogether (US1YTIPS/US2YTIPS have
// matched 5-year-origin Apr15/Oct15 bonds at some points, not just the 10-year-origin
// Jan15/Jul15 family) — no fixed rule reproduces this. Rollover dates are instead pinned
// individually by cross-checking CNBC's own historical yield against real FedInvest
// settlement prices (TreasuryDirect's historical price tool) for every plausible
// candidate bond (any TIPS maturity in the plausible tenor range, any family), computing
// each candidate's implied yield via bond-math.js and taking whichever bond's implied
// yield is closest to CNBC's reported yield that day. FedInvest's `sell` price (what a
// holder receives — the bid) is used, falling back to `buy` (the ask) when a candidate
// has no active bid that day (`sell=0`) — CNBC's own quotes are bid-side, so `sell` is
// the correct proxy, not `buy`. (An earlier version of this had the two backwards —
// `buy`-primary — which silently corrupted several pinned dates below: it manufactured
// a brief intermediate cohort in Feb 2025 that doesn't survive the corrected price, and
// shifted two other boundary dates by a few days.) The raw `eod` evaluated price is not
// used at all: it was found to produce a stale, misleading price on at least one no-bid
// day. Some transitions resolve to more than one intermediate cohort in quick succession
// rather than a single clean flip; each is recorded as its own entry rather than picked
// as one "the" transition date. Not every period resolves: when candidate bonds' implied
// yields are too close together to disambiguate reliably (a flat 1-2yr TIPS curve), that
// stretch is left as an explicit gap rather than guessed — including gaps *between* two
// resolved cohorts, recorded as a `{ from, maturity: null }` entry (no TipsRef.csv row
// has a null maturity, so resolveTipsBond() naturally returns "no match" for that span).
