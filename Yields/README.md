# Yields: TIPS Seasonal Adjustments

A browser-based tool for analyzing **Seasonally Adjusted (SA)** and **SA Outlier-adjusted (SAO)** TIPS yields. This project helps identify "cheap" or "rich" spots on the TIPS curve by removing predictable seasonal inflation noise.

## Features
- **Interactive Yield Curve**: Compare Market Ask, SA, and SAO yields.
- **Broker Integration**: Upload Schwab or Fidelity CSVs to see your own quotes adjusted.
- **Drill-down Transparency**: Click any SA yield to see the exact multiplicative factor and adjustment math.
- **SAO Trend Fitting**: See the institutional view of the yield curve via backwards-anchored linear regression.

## Getting Started
- **Live Version**: [https://aerokam.github.io/TIPS/Yields/](https://aerokam.github.io/TIPS/Yields/)
- **Local Dev**:
  1. From the monorepo root: `npx serve .`
  2. Open `http://localhost:8080/Yields/` in your browser. (Note: Root serving is required for shared components).
