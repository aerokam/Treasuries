# 0.0 Data Pipeline — TreasuryAuctions

## Data Sources

### Historical Auction Results (`Auctions.csv`)
- **Source:** FiscalData — `api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/accounting/od/auctions_query`
- **Script:** `scripts/getAuctions.js` (repo root scripts/)
- **R2 key:** `Treasuries/Auctions.csv`
- **Public URL:** `https://pub-ba11062b177640459f72e0a88d0261ae.r2.dev/Treasuries/Auctions.csv`
- **GH workflow:** `get-auctions.yml` — runs at 11:05 AM ET and 1:35 PM ET on weekdays

#### Update logic
- **First run** (no existing R2 file): fetches all auctions since 1980-01-01
- **Subsequent runs:** fetches last 30 days from FiscalData, merges with existing R2 file; new data wins on conflict; deduped by `cusip + auction_date`

### Upcoming Auctions
- **Source:** FiscalData upcoming auctions endpoint — `api.fiscaldata.treasury.gov/services/api/fiscal_service/v1/accounting/od/upcoming_auctions`
- **Fetched live** by the browser on page load (no R2, no caching)
- **TIPS Identification:** Cross-referenced against the Tentative Auction Schedule XML mirror (see below), matching `auction_date` + `security_term`; also checked for "TIPS" in `security_type`.
- Filtered to `auction_date >= today`

### Tentative Auction Schedule (`Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`)
- **Source:** Treasury.gov Tentative Auction Schedule XML — `home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`
- **Script:** `scripts/updateTentativeSchedule.js`
- **Local task:** `TreasuryAuctions-TentativeSchedule`, set up by `scripts/setup-tentative-schedule-task.ps1` — Treasury revises this schedule at its Quarterly Refunding press conference (first Wednesday of Feb/May/Aug/Nov), with the document itself updated ~1–3 weeks later, so the task runs daily for 21 days after each of the next 2 quarterly-refunding dates, plus a monthly safety-net check the rest of the year. A companion task, `TreasuryAuctions-TentativeSchedule-Refresh`, re-runs the same setup script quarterly to roll the trigger window forward — no manual maintenance needed
- **R2 key:** `Treasuries/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`
- **Public URL:** `https://pub-ba11062b177640459f72e0a88d0261ae.r2.dev/Treasuries/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.xml`
- **Logic:** Raw XML mirrored to R2 (the browser can't fetch `home.treasury.gov` directly — no CORS). Fetched directly by the TreasuryAuctions UI, which parses `<AuctionCalendarDate>` nodes and matches each upcoming-auction row by `AuctionDate` + `SecurityTermWeekYear` to flag `TIPS`, `reopening`, and `floating_rate`.

## UI Views

Four filtered views, each with its own default visible column set (configurable by user):

| View | Filter |
|---|---|
| All | No filter |
| Bills | `security_type === 'Bill'` |
| Notes/Bonds | `security_type !== 'Bill'` AND `inflation_index_security !== 'Yes'` |
| TIPS | `inflation_index_security === 'Yes'` |

Default row cap: 100 rows for non-TIPS views when no date range is active. TIPS view and any date-ranged view are uncapped.
